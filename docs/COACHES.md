# The coaching staff — detect-and-correct loops against slop

AI builds fast; unregulated speed compounds into slop. We run quality like a football staff — three
seats with distinct jobs:

- **Head coach (orchestrator).** Decides what runs when: WIP limits, dispatch, merge tempo, and the
  don't-collide-with-feature-work rule. The policy is codified as the **`/governor`** drill
  (`.claude/skills/governor/SKILL.md`): one dispatch cycle — WIP check → gate-named target → collision
  check → cheap-tier athlete → PR with auto-merge per the merge-policy table. Judgment calls (what may
  auto-merge, recruiting new athletes) remain Eric + Claude in-session; scheduling the cycle is earned
  by reps, not assumed.
- **Defensive coordinator.** Protects the standard: breaks down complexity and organizes the pieces.
  Owns the detect-and-correct units below (gates, ratchets, drills, athletes). Defense keeps entropy
  from scoring.
- **Offensive coordinator.** Scales up systems where a **constraint** binds (Theory of Constraints:
  *elevate*). Owns capability plays: the single-runner pipeline (GHA-minutes constraint), the local
  verify gate (review-trust constraint), Babylon MCP (domain-knowledge constraint), the local dev loop
  (iteration-speed constraint). Offense moves the ceiling; each play is triggered by a *measured*
  constraint, never speculation — same discipline as run-scale infra.

## The defensive unit — one quality dimension per loop

- **Eye (fitness function):** an executable eval that measures the dimension and enforces a committed,
  **ratchet-down-only budget** in CI. Prose audits drift; evals don't.
- **Drill (skill):** the repeatable corrective procedure, invokable as a slash command by a human or
  loaded by an agent. One safe, behavior-preserving move per PR.
- **Athlete (agent):** a scoped background worker that runs eye → drill → small green PR, off the
  critical path.

Slop accumulates precisely in the dimensions no defensive loop watches. Growing this roster *is* the
quality strategy (audit: `docs/ENGINEERING-AUDIT-2026-07.md`).

## The codification ladder — how work becomes delegable

Work descends this ladder as its contract gets written; each rung frees the head coach's attention:

1. **Manual** — done ad hoc in-session; judgment throughout.
2. **Skill** — the procedure is codified (a drill, e.g. `/decompose`, `/dedupe`); a human or Claude invokes it.
3. **Gated** — the trigger is mechanized (`--candidate` names the target); no one picks the work.
4. **Agent** — the full contract (trigger, procedure, verification, output) is written; a background athlete runs it end to end.

**The rule of three applies to agents:** do it manually once; codify the skill on the second recurrence; promote to an agent on the third. Speculative roster-building is premature abstraction — the roster recruits itself from demonstrated repetition. A subagent is what a piece of work becomes when its contract is complete. What cannot yet be contracted — taste, the yay/nay on a scene, which constraint matters next — stays with the head coach. **Model tier follows contract completeness:** rung-4 work runs on cheaper/faster models; judgment-incomplete work stays on the strongest model. Every toil-killer is the same loop (measure → judge → one bounded move → ratchet); defense's move is subtraction, offense's is substitution.

## Resource cost is a fitness dimension

The constraint isn't only Eric's attention — it's every **finite resource** a run consumes: tokens,
GitHub API budget (esp. the scarce 5k/hr GraphQL bucket), GHA minutes, wall-clock. Treat waste in
these the way defense treats slop: measure it, and convert the recurring cost into a one-time one.

**Codify the loop into a script/codemod.** A model-in-the-loop procedure costs tokens (and often API
calls) *every* time; a script is a one-time build cost, then **~free per run forever** — and it can't
drift back to the expensive habit the way a prose instruction can. This is the self-healing flywheel:
each codified loop lowers the marginal cost of the next unit of work, so throughput compounds while
cost falls. Sound architecture + proper tooling + clean config make the next script cheaper to build,
compounding it further.

Worked example (the one that motivated this): landing a PR via the GitHub **MCP** spends **GraphQL**
by the thousands (one create+auto-merge+read cycle measured ~6,000 points; status-*polling* is worse),
while the same outcome over `git` + repo-scoped **REST** runs on your machine and the plentiful 15k/hr
**core** bucket. The fix was codified as `scripts/ship.sh` + the `/ship` skill: verify locally → push →
open over REST → one auto-merge call → **stop, trust the webhook, never poll**. Reach for the script;
grow the roster of scripts as recurring costs surface. When a finite resource starts binding, that's a
*measured* constraint the offensive coordinator elevates — never optimize a resource speculatively.

## Adopting a convention creates conformance debt — grandfather, then shrink

First separate the two kinds of convention, because they create very different debt:

- **Retroactive-judging** (a lint rule, a design token, a naming standard) — instantly makes the
  *existing* corpus non-conforming. Do **not** big-bang-rewrite history: **grandfather the existing
  violations, conform all NEW work, ratchet the budget down as files are touched** — exactly how the
  arch/clone/spec-gap gates already work. The debt is real but paid down incrementally, never in a
  churn-heavy sweep.
- **Forward-additive** (EARS — a *new artifact* you start producing: formal requirement statements) —
  creates ~**no back-catalog debt**, because there was nothing of that kind before to be non-conforming.
  You don't grandfather anything; you just start doing it on new work. Beware the category error of
  "conforming" things the convention doesn't even govern — EARS judges *requirements*, not the existing
  *specs* (verifications) or shipped plans, so those need no retrofit at all.

"Adopt EARS" was ~5 files precisely because it's forward-additive — not because 80 files were
grandfathered. Diagnose which kind you're adopting before you reach for a sweep.

**Corollary — know who the convention is for.** EARS is a *developer* convention: it lives in
dev-facing intake (the PR template, plans, the `/ears` drill). User-facing intake (the issue
templates, the `/feedback` form) stays **plain-language** for non-technical friends & family — triage
translates their report into EARS acceptance criteria (via `/ears`) *before* it becomes buildable work.
A convention that taxes the wrong audience is slop wearing a suit.

## Detection lag is the metric that finds the gaps in the system itself

Every coach above watches the *code*. One watches **us**: the learning Coach
(`scripts/incident-scan.mjs` → `/retro` → `docs/LESSONS.md`). Its dimension is **detection lag** —
the time between the earliest moment a failure *could* have been noticed and the moment it actually
was. Lag of seconds (a spec goes red) means the nets are working. Lag of days means an entire class
of failure is currently invisible, and *that* is the finding — always bigger than the bug that
revealed it.

Two rules fall out, both paid for the hard way (see the ledger):

- **When you change a shared system, enumerate every actor that crosses it.** Branch protection has
  more consumers than pull requests (semantic-release pushes to `main`); npm's `prepare` has more
  callers than developers (the Dockerfile's `npm ci`, which runs *before* `COPY . .`). Both deploy
  outages were the same move: a correct change to a shared thing, with the consumer list never
  enumerated. The second name on that list is usually the bug.
- **Prefer shortening detection lag over preventing the specific bug.** Fixing one instance buys one
  instance; a signal that surfaces the whole class buys every future one. The outage that motivated
  this Coach was invisible for four merges *because nothing watched a red `main`* — the missing
  watcher was the real defect, and it is now the eye.

**Put the watcher on a path you already walk — never add a poller.** The tempting way to watch a red
`main` is a scheduled workflow: a cron that wakes up and *asks*. That spends GHA minutes and API
budget on a question, which is exactly the pattern `scripts/ship.sh` exists to delete — a monitor
built that way is the resource-cost smell wearing a safety vest. Instead, hang the check on traffic
that already flows. Every change here ships through `ship.sh open`, so the incident eye runs there:
one REST call on the core bucket, at the one moment the answer changes a decision (don't stack a
change on a broken `main`). Detection lag collapses to "the next time we ship" for zero recurring
cost. Generalize it: **a monitor that needs its own schedule is usually a monitor attached to the
wrong event.** Find the existing checkpoint first.

A failure is also the cheapest map of an unguarded region: while standing in it, log the adjacent
"what else is exposed this way?" threads to `docs/IDEAS.md` as side quests. That is the learning
flywheel — each incident buys both a prevention and a set of leads.

## Sourcing rule

**Adopt what's generic; craft what's bound to our gates.** Generic craftsmanship (code review, security
review, simplification) is solved — use the bundled skills. Anything that leans on our mechanics
(arch-budget, dupe-budget, Graphify, the design system) must be crafted here. Community skills are a
supply-chain decision: read them fully before adopting.

## Special teams — situational units

Not every play is a down-in/down-out defensive loop. Special teams are situational crews with their own playbooks, run occasionally:

- **dep-warden** — reviews dependency-update PRs: reads changelogs, runs the suite, merges patch/minor on green, escalates majors. (First named unit; agent not yet built.)
- **Migrations** — one-shot tool/platform upgrades (e.g. Biome 2.x): run the migrator, triage fallout with judgment, land as one PR.
- **Incident response** — rollback drills, post-deploy failure handling (the pipeline's smoke → rollback is the mechanized first responder).
- **Release verification** — periodic prod screenshot/probe beyond the smoke test.

Dead-code, duplication, size — those stay regular defense: same eye/drill/ratchet shape every down.

## The scaling test — two axes, opposite defaults

Every decision gets asked *"does this scale?"* — but the answer depends on which axis, and the two run
**opposite** directions:

- **Build-scale (code · architecture · process): design as if thousands contribute.** Solo-with-agents
  effectively *is* a large team — many parallel hands, high commit velocity, no shared memory between
  sessions. So the eval question "would 10,000 engineers trip over this?" applies today: cohesion, no
  junk drawers, single-sourced helpers, machine-checkable conventions. Organized, high-quality code is
  what scales the *ability to build*.
- **Run-scale (infrastructure · platform): design for the real load — 5–10 people.** Here the enterprise
  reflex is the smell: microservices, k8s, caching tiers, queues for ten friends is slop wearing a suit.
  One Fly app + smoke + rollback is *correct* at this load. Infra earns complexity only when **measured**
  load demands it — never speculatively.

One line: **scale the ability to build, not the machinery to serve.** Confusing the axes is the classic
failure in both directions (spaghetti that can't grow ↔ a cluster for ten users).

## Smell catalog — what the eyes look for (and what stays judgment)

Every smell is either **mechanizable** (→ becomes/extends an eval) or **judgment** (→ lives in a drill's
checklist). Route new smells accordingly; a smell that stays prose in someone's head protects nothing.

| Smell | Kind | Where it's handled |
|---|---|---|
| God file (size × many exports) | mechanized | `arch-scan` |
| Exact duplication (same symbol, N files) | mechanized | `dupe-scan` |
| **Junk drawer** (`utils.ts`/`helpers.ts`/`common.ts`/`misc.ts` — cohesion by what it *isn't*) | mechanized | `arch-scan` (junk-drawer check) |
| Near-duplication ("something similar exists") | judgment | `/dedupe` drill — **rule of three:** abstract on the third occurrence, not the second; premature abstraction couples things that merely look alike |
| Sanity checks bleeding downstream (re-validating what a boundary should guarantee) | judgment | review checklist — fix the *boundary* (zod at the edges, audit C3), don't scatter guards |
| Design-system drift (pasted tokens/styles) | mechanized (coarse) | `dupe-scan` today; richer token-diff eval later |

## Atomic design — the decompose grammar

Decomposition needs a *target shape*, not just "smaller." We use atomic design:

- **Atoms** — one job, no siblings' knowledge: `escapeHtml`, `chip()`, a shader, a payoff function.
- **Molecules** — a few atoms with one purpose: a card, a nav, the Eye (shader + lids + gaze).
- **Organisms** — molecules composing a surface: a dashboard view, the tower scene, the login stage.

**Atoms are the default floor.** Go sub-atomic only when a concrete need calls (a second consumer wants
half the atom) — never speculatively. Over-splitting is the mirror-image slop: a thousand two-line files
with the complexity moved into the wiring.

## How the loop runs (and stays orderly)

- Every eye enforces in CI through the ordinary test job — a Coach's dimension cannot silently regress.
- Budgets **only ratchet down** (`--update` after a correction lands), so every win is permanent.
- `--candidate` makes each eye name its own highest-leverage target, machine-readable — no human picks.
- **WIP limit: one open structural PR per Coach.** The athlete doesn't start pass N+1 until pass N merges;
  the next target is recomputed from fresh `main`, which serializes work for free.
- Adding a Coach = one eval + one budget + one CI spec + one skill (+ optionally one agent). Use
  `skill-creator` and mirror an existing pair so the roster stays uniform.
