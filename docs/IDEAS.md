# Ideas & Backlog

The durable home for ideas so they leave the working context but never get lost. Eric injects
thoughts freely; Claude routes each one here (see the routing convention in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)). The in-session task list is the *working subset* pulled from this file;
this file is the permanent record (the session environment is ephemeral — uncommitted notes die with
it).

**Format:** newest ideas at the top of _Inbox_. When one is picked up, move it to _In progress_, and
to _Shipped_ (with the PR#) when done. Keep entries one or two lines — enough to reconstruct intent.

**Attribution:** every idea records its source and the proximity that exposed it —
`_(src: Eric | Claude · while: <context>)_`. Eric-sourced entries are intent; Claude-sourced ones
(_Side quests_ below) are proposals to prune. Items without a tag predate this convention and are
Eric-sourced.

## Inbox (captured, not yet started)

### Larger tasks (need dedicated focus)
- **Login terminal drawer + backstory** — convert the canvas play-panel into a terminal-style DOM
  drawer that opens with a preamble/backstory. (tasks #68/#72; canvas→DOM migration; best done live.)
- **Two modes** — intro `/login` = fast preview (gist, gloss details); logged-in = slow, controllable,
  studyable inspection. (task #54)
- **Decoupled playcall drawer** — a left collapsible drawer housing Signal→Play→profit, decoupled from
  the trend chart, carried into the logged-in view; move the playcall recap into it with a connector
  line to its chart position. (tasks #49 + #51-remainder)
- **North-star autonomous pipeline** — recycle the playbook artifact as a systems-level pipeline
  toward autonomous deployment (recognize signal → recommend → trade, with safeguards). (task #41)
- **Lore universe (mixed multiverse)** — give each persona a character card (name, archetype,
  allegiance, one-line legend) surfaced on `/u/:id` and woven into trade narration + cityscape + copy;
  keep the system extensible to adopt others' ideas. Confirm the pantheon direction with Eric before
  broad rollout. (task #79; Sauron + the Eye of Sauron are the first thread.)

### Feedback / engagement
- **Gamify feedback as "side quests"** — the core group skews D&D/gamer, so framing idea-contribution
  as accepting/proposing side quests could organically pique interest. v1 shipped (the `/feedback`
  "idea" kind is now a 🗺️ Side quest). Deeper version: a light quest board — proposed side quests
  visible, upvotable, with playful status (open → accepted → shipped), tied into the lore universe.

### Side quests (surfaced by Claude while working — proposals to prune)
- **Eye searchlight sweep + drifting embers** — at rest, a slow narrow beam from the Eye scans the
  skyline, and embers drift up from the tower; deepens the lore anchor without stealing focus.
  _(src: Claude · while: making the Eye of Sauron more pronounced)_
- **Tie billboard ticker prices to the real sim market** — the marquee prices are independent seeded
  walks; driving them from the actual sim tape (or the `/pulse` cohort data) would make the city
  cohere with the trend it sits under. _(src: Claude · while: adding ticker billboards)_
- **Reduced-motion "distant flash"** — under `prefers-reduced-motion` the storm never fires lightning
  (rainT never reaches the threshold); render one static distant flash so the frozen frame still reads
  as a storm. _(src: Claude · while: adding the rain + lightning storm)_
- **Verify + polish the 3-bot board** — with Sauron added, sanity-check the leaderboard /
  bots-vs-humans / compare views with three bots (ordering, cohort aggregates, spacing). The offline
  server render got interrupted and was never confirmed. _(src: Claude · while: adding the Sauron persona)_
- **Login canvas frame-budget audit** — the login now stacks rain + weather + Eye + city + beams +
  playcall; a quick perf pass (frame cap, offscreen work, DPR cost) would protect the "lovable" feel
  on weaker devices. _(src: Claude · while: layering cityscape effects)_
- **Persona WATCHING richness parity** — the playcall's WATCHING/fear-greed panel is rich; the six
  older personas have plain one-line theses. A light pass could give each a signature "watches"
  signal, feeding the future lore cards. _(src: Claude · while: adding the Sauron persona)_

### Eric's governance calls (do not build unattended)
- **Feedback triage / auto-fix automation** on the issues the in-app funnel now creates. (task #74)
- **Self-service "request feedback access"** collaborator flow — largely *superseded* by the in-app
  feedback funnel (PR #80); likely closeable. (task #76)
- **History / persistence backend** — append-only equity + realized-P/L history to unlock
  performance-over-time, win rate, and "which plays worked" across the four observatory views (they
  currently ship with honest "coming once we have history" seams).
