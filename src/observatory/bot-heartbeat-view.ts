 * BOT HEARTBEAT (#3687 slice 2) — is this bot's decision loop alive, and what is each of its

 *
 * Silence has three causes that must never read alike: the market is closed, the loop is down, or
 * the loop is running and nothing fired. Only the second is a problem, so the state is judged
 * against the market session first and the pass cadence second.
